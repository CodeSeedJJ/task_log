[2025-04-25 14:02:44] made some nice changes to the CLI on my website, a cool border functioning commands, a decent prompt. a nice border with rounded edges, learned quite a lot. lost it all in some fumble and decided to make something simpler. 
[2025-04-25 14:04:44] so i made this app to log my daily activity in the hopes of keeping motivation to continue learning
[2025-04-25 14:10:48] added a new line function for better readability

[2025-04-25 14:15:11] third time lucky trying to get a new line on this dang log

[2025-04-25 14:16:54] tested it again to make sure.. I'll push it for a green square if all goes well, and maybe try that website again after some lunch.

[2025-04-25 14:40:27] testing to see if the line length limiter works with the wrapping triggering and not looking so silly on the page. this should probably be long enough. it wasn't so i manually came in here to write a bunch of garbage to see if it works now, I really hope no one ever reads this.

[2025-04-25 14:48:07] this really really really really actually probably, maybe. might work this time.
man what journet I should have finished that CLI on my website instead.. here's
to keeping the calander green! and a little padding at the end to ensure we're
over the line limit.
